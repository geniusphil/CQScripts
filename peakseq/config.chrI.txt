# There are currently two models for simulating the background for threshold selection
# Simulated background is the simulation based method that is explained in the PeakSeq paper.
# Poisson background uses a simple Poisson background with mean estimated from the read statistics. This option is still experimental but it is much faster than the simulated background option.
